 My First Website!
No! All of the paragraphs in the generator are written by humans, not computers.
When first building this generator <a href="Day_4_Page_2.html"> we thought </a> about using computers to generate the paragraphs,
but they weren't very< good and many times didn't make any sense at all.
 We therefore <a href="http://google.com"> took the </a>time to create paragraphs specifically for this generator to make it the best that we could.
