# Writing Your First HTML Code

`<!DOCTYPE html>` - This tells the browser that it is an html file


`<html></html>` - This tells the browser where the file starts and end


`<title> </title>` - This tag gives the name of the website

`<meta>` - This tag tells the browser the type of characters that we will be using. This type we will be using is
utf-8. The syntax is `<meta charset="utf-8">`


# Paragraphs and Headings

`<p> </p>` - This tells the browser that the content withis this tag is a paragraph. The remaining content will be displayed on the next line after the </p> tag ends.

## Headings
This is used to make a particular line as a heading.


The tag used here is `<h1>`. There are a total of 6 heading tags, `<h1>` to `<h6>`. As it the number goes on increasing, the size of the content within the heading tag goes on diminishing.

Ex: `<h1> Heading 1</h1>`

   ` <h2> Heading 2 </h2>`

# Bold and Italics

## Bold

`<strong></strong>` - This tag is used to convert the normal content within it to bols characters

## Italics

`<em></em>` - This tag is used to convert a normal content within it to italic text.

## Note:
`<b></b> <i></i>` tags also make a content within it as bold and italic. But it is not usually
used.

## Comment 
`< !-- Enter your comment -->` - This is used to write a comment.
