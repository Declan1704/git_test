<strong>No! All of the paragraphs in the </strong>generator are written by humans, not computers.
When first <em>building this generator we</em> thought about using computers to generate the paragraphs,
 <strong><em>but they weren't very</strong></em> good and many times didn't make any sense at all.
 We therefore took the time to create paragraphs specifically for this generator to make it the best that we could.

    Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day.
    The writer has <span> no idea what topic the random </span> paragraph will be about when it appears.
    This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges.
    The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create.
    The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending.</div>
