# The Box Model
Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another.
You can get a rough idea of how this works by sticking a border on every item on the page like this:

```
* {
  border: 2px solid red;
```

there are many ways to manipulate the size of these boxes, and the space between them, using `padding`, `margin`, and `border`.
