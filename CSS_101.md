# Introduction
After developing your basic html website its important to give some styles to the html file to make
the web page more vibrant.

This is where CSS comes to play. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change fonts,
background colour and many more.

At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. These rules are made up of a selector (more on this in a bit) and a semicolon-separated list of declarations,
with each of those declarations being made up of a property–value pair.

## Selectors

Selectors simply refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they’re what is actually being “selected” for each rule.

### Universal selector

The universal selector will select elements of any type, hence the name “universal”, and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. 
In the example below, every element would have the color: purple; style applied to it.

```
* {
  color: purple;
}
```

### Type selectors

A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:

```
<!-- index.html -->

<div>Hello, World!</div>
<div>Hello again!</div>
<p>Hi...</p>
<div>Okay, bye.</div>
```

```
/* styles.css */

div {
  color: white;
}
```

Here, all three `<div>` elements would be selected, while the `<p>` element wouldn’t be.


### Class selectors

Class selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element.
Here’s how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:

```
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>
```

```
/* styles.css */

.alert-text {
  color: red;
}
```

Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class="alert-text severe-alert"`. Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.

### ID selectors

ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element.
The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:

```
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
```

```
/* styles.css */

#title {
  background-color: red;
}
```

### The grouping selector

What if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?

```
.read {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
  /* several unique declarations */
}
```

Both our `.read` and `.unread` selectors share the `color: white;` and` background-color: black;` declarations, 
but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, 
we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:

```
.read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}
```


### Chaining selectors

Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation.
Let’s say we had the following HTML:

```
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
```

We have two elements with the subsection class that have some sort of unique styles, 
but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has header as a second class? 
Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:

```
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
```













## External Sheets
Suppose you want to give some colour and designs to your web page, we do it externally using another file and give it an extension of `.css`

Now if you want to refer the external file, then we refer the external file. So first we must make another file and give it the extension
.css. Now on the main html page in order to execute the css file we use the following tag
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css">`

If suppose we want add css styling to the body then the syntax will be
```
body{
  background-color:(color_name);
  color:(font_color);
  font-size:(size)
}
```

Ex:

```
body{
  background-color:black;
  color:white;
  font-size:21px;
  }
```

You can also do it for other tags also. 
Ex:

```
p{
  background-color:white;
  font-size:20px;
  }
```

## Divs and Spans

The `<div>` is just used to separate a particular content.

**Syntax**

```
<div>
  Your content
</div>
```

Ex:

```
<div>
This is my first div
</div>
```
If we want to style it then

```
div{
  background-color:green;
  width:500px;
  height:500px;
}
```

Span is bascically used to markup or highlight a particular line of text.

In the html file 

`<span>Your text</span>`

If you want to style your specific span text then,

```
span{
  color:blue;
  font-size:20px;
}
```

#Classes and ID's

Classes is basically used when you want to put different colour to different paragraphs, then 
you divide them in classes.i.e. int the tag, you mention the name `class` and then you assign 
it with a name.

For ex:

In the html file

```
<div class="class-name">
content
</div>
```

In the CSS file

```
class-name{
attributes
}
```

An ID the other way, is similar to classes. But we can have only one ID for each page.

In the html file we use the same syntax as that of a class, but instead of using the class keyword, 
we use the `id` keyword.

And in the CSS file we use `#` instead of `.`.
