# Introduction
After developing your basic html website its important to give some styles to the html file to make
the web page more vibrant.

This is where CSS comes to play. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change fonts,
background colour and many more.

## External Sheets
Suppose you want to give some colour and designs to your web page, we do it externally using another file and give it an extension of `.css`

Now if you want to refer the external file, then we refer the external file. So first we must make another file and give it the extension
.css. Now on the main html page in order to execute the css file we use the following tag
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css">`

If suppose we want add css styling to the body then the syntax will be
```
body{
  background-color:(color_name);
  color:(font_color);
  font-size:(size)
}
```

Ex:

```
body{
  background-color:black;
  color:white;
  font-size:21px;
  }
```

You can also do it for other tags also. 
Ex:

```
p{
  background-color:white;
  font-size:20px;
  }
```

## Divs and Spans

The `<div>` is just used to separate a particular content.

**Syntax**

```
<div>
  Your content
</div>
```

Ex:

```
<div>
This is my first div
</div>
```
If we want to style it then

```
div{
  background-color:green;
  width:500px;
  height:500px;
}
```
