# Introduction
After developing your basic html website its important to give some styles to the html file to make
the web page more vibrant.

This is where CSS comes to play. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change fonts,
background colour and many more.

## External Sheets
Suppose you want to give some colour and designs to your web page, we do it externally using another file and give it an extension of `.css`

Now if you want to refer the external file, then we refer the external file. So first we must make another file and give it the extension
.css. Now on the main html page in order to execute the css file we use the following tag
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css">`

If suppose we want add css styling to the body then the syntax will be
```
body{
  background-color:(color_name);
  color:(font_color);
  font-size:(size)
}
```

Ex:

```
body{
  background-color:black;
  color:white;
  font-size:21px;
  }
```

You can also do it for other tags also. 
Ex:

```
p{
  background-color:white;
  font-size:20px;
  }
```

## Divs and Spans

The `<div>` is just used to separate a particular content.

**Syntax**

```
<div>
  Your content
</div>
```

Ex:

```
<div>
This is my first div
</div>
```
If we want to style it then

```
div{
  background-color:green;
  width:500px;
  height:500px;
}
```

Span is bascically used to markup or highlight a particular line of text.

In the html file 

`<span>Your text</span>`

If you want to style your specific span text then,

```
span{
  color:blue;
  font-size:20px;
}
```

#Classes and ID's

Classes is basically used when you want to put different colour to different paragraphs, then 
you divide them in classes.i.e. int the tag, you mention the name `class` and then you assign 
it with a name.

For ex:

In the html file

```
<div class="class-name">
content
</div>
```

In the CSS file

```
class-name{
attributes
}
```

An ID the other way, is similar to classes. But we can have only one ID for each page.

In the html file we use the same syntax as that of a class, but instead of using the class keyword, 
we use the `id` keyword.

And in the CSS file we use `#` instead of `.`.
