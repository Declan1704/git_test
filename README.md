# HTML

## Definition:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. We use HTML elements to create all of the paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and links that make up a typical webpage.

## Elements and Tags

- Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: `<p>`.

- Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: </p>.

  Ex: A full paragraph element looks like this:

`<p>some text content</p>`.
