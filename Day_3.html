<strong>No! All of the paragraphs in the </strong>generator are written by humans, not computers.
When first <em>building this generator we</em> thought about using computers to generate the paragraphs,
 <strong><em>but they weren't very</strong></em> good and many times didn't make any sense at all.
 We therefore took the time to create paragraphs specifically for this generator to make it the best that we could.
